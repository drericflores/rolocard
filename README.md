An eRolodex Apple Hypercard clone
The Rolodex Index Card Application is a versatile tool designed for managing and organizing information in a structured, card-based format. Originally inspired by the concept of a traditional rolodex, this digital version allows users to create, edit, and navigate through virtual index cards, each containing text and attachments. The application supports rich text formatting, including bold, italics, and underline, ensuring that users can highlight and structure their notes effectively. 

Cards are managed in a sequence, with features to move forward and backward through the deck, as well as options to add, delete, and tag cards for easy categorization. The content of each card is saved in a structured format (JSON), ensuring that all data, including formatting, is preserved across sessions.

The application is built using Python 3 and the PyQt5 framework, providing a modern and responsive graphical user interface (GUI). It includes tools to attach files and images to cards, making it a comprehensive solution for various organizational needs.

Designed for cross-platform compatibility, the Rolodex Index Card Application is particularly well-suited for users who need a simple yet powerful tool to manage information, whether for personal, educational, or professional purposes. It also supports integration into the Pop!_OS environment, allowing for seamless operation within this Linux distribution.

The application is open-source, licensed under the MIT License, encouraging further development and customization by the community. With its intuitive interface and robust feature set, the Rolodex Index Card Application serves as a practical tool for anyone needing a reliable system to organize and retrieve information efficiently.
